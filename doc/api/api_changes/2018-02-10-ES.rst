GTKAgg and GTKCairo backends deprecated
```````````````````````````````````````
The GTKAgg and GTKCairo backends have been deprecated. These obsolete backends
allow figures to be rendered via the GTK+ 2 toolkit. They are untested, known
to be broken, will not work with Python 3, and their use has been discouraged
for some time. Instead, use the `GTK3Agg` and `GTK3Cairo` backends for
rendering to GTK+ 3 windows.
