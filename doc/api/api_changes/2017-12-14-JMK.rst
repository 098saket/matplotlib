Fontsizes less than 1 pt are clipped to be 1 pt.
------------------------------------------------

FreeType doesn't allow fonts to get smaller than 1 pt, so all Agg
backends were silently rounding up to 1 pt.  PDF (other vector
backends?) were letting us write fonts that were less than 1 pt, but
they could not be placed properly because position information comes from
FreeType.  This change makes it so no backends can use fonts smaller than
1 pt, consistent with FreeType and ensuring more consistent results across
backends.
